-Logic Changing
-- GysahlGreens got updated to drop other items for chocobo breeding/stats.
// -- Gysahl Greens now drop from the crops based on biome.
~~ Fixed Gysahl Green planting Bug related to int below 0

-- Fixed chocoboChecks isOceanBlocked to properly return the correct value.

- Preparation for Brains
-- Added the Brain class for chocobos.
~~ Class is complete, but not used yet.
-- Added Helper methods to the Chocobo Entity to handle the Brain.
~~ Helper methods include:
// -- getPathfinderFavor()  || Corrected to return the favor of the pathfinder
// -- canAttackwithOwner()
~~ implemented using smarter checks
// -- isWaterBreathing(), isFlameBlood(), isWaterBlooded(), isFireImmune()
~~ isWaterBreathing() and isWaterBlooded() were split from isWaterBreathing().
~~~~ isWaterBlooded() checks if the chocobo has permanent water breathing, which is stored in the entity data, and isWaterBreathing() checks if the chocobo has temporary or Permanent water breathing, which is not stored.
~~ isFlameBlood() and isFireImmune() were split from isFireImmune().
 ~~~ isFlameBlood() checks if the chocobo has permanent fire immunity, which is stored in the entity data, and isFireImmune() checks if the chocobo has temporary or Permanent fire immunity, which is not stored. isFireImmune() used like this because it is called in the EntityLivingBase class, which does not have access to the entity data.
 // -- onStatusEffectAdded(), onStatusEffectRemoved()
~~ onStatusEffectAdded() and onStatusEffectRemoved() were added as overloads to manually trigger the setPathfindingPenalty for the nodes that used conditional logic such as isFireImmune & isWaterBreathing.
-- Added the initial setPathfindingPenalty() method to the Chocobo Entity Constructor.

- Chocobo Entity Refactor
-- Corrected Chocobo Entity Spawn to actually limit the amount of Chocobos spawned in a chunk.
-- Removed improper getPathfindingFavor() method from the Chocobo Entity.
-- Corrected & Updated the Logice for the Chocobo Entity in regards to Liquid interaction.
